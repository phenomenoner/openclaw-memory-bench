# Devlog — 2026-02-08

## Milestone 1: Repository bootstrap

Completed:
- Initialized standalone benchmark toolkit scaffold.
- Added MIT license.
- Added acknowledgements policy for `supermemoryai/memorybench`.
- Added minimal Python 3.13 + uv project setup.
- Added CLI skeleton:
  - `doctor` (environment + adapter inventory)
  - `plan` (run-manifest generator)
- Added adapter protocol and two adapter entries:
  - `openclaw-mem` (initial CLI-based ingest/search adapter)
  - `memu-engine` (stub for next implementation step)
- Added ADR 0001 documenting scope/license decision.

## Milestone 2: Early planning docs

Completed:
- Added draft benchmark spec (`docs/spec-v0.1.md`).
- Added `memu-engine` adapter implementation plan (`docs/memu-adapter-plan.md`).

Next:
1. Implement benchmark dataset loader contract (LoCoMo/LongMemEval/ConvoMem adapters).
2. Implement retrieval metric engine and deterministic scorer.
3. Add container-tag isolation strategy for `openclaw-mem` adapter.
4. Implement `memu-engine` adapter via Gateway tool-invoke route.
